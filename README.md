# Haikubot-chatbot
A simple LLM built on gpt-35-turbo. I use AzureOpenAI for connectivity

This is a brief practice of the connectivity and training of OpenAI's LLM connections. I desicded to make it funny by making it do everything in Haiku's instead of the general "Helpful assistant prompt"

It creates a chat loop, eliminating the need to hardcode all calls and responses into the code itself.
